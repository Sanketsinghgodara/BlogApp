# Blog Application

This is a full-stack Blog Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Users can register, log in, and manage their own posts. This project is a great starting point for learning the MERN stack and understanding how to build a complete web application from scratch.

## Features

- User authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout)
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for blog posts
- Responsive design using React and Tailwind CSS
- RESTful API with Express.js and Node.js
- Data storage using MongoDB and Mongoose
- Form validation and error handling
- Protected routes for authenticated users
